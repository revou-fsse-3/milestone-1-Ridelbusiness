                    <h2>The philosophy</h2>
                    <p>Not like the classic animation studios, Studio Ghibli was born with one goal: to explore the depths of the 
                        human soul, and to offer Japanese and international audiences poetic stories that would translate all its complexity. 
                        No international commercial strategy, but a concern for integrity and exemplary quality, for which its 
                        productions are renowned.</p>

                    <h2>The beginnings of the studio</h2>
                    <p>Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki met in the 1960s when working for the Japanese animation studio T√¥ei D√¥ga. The two men worked 
                        together for more than a decade notably on the animation Heidi. But it wasn't until the early 1980s, when the growth of 
                        animation on television threatened the quality of productions, that these two enthusiasts decided to join forces to offer 
                        the public a quality animated feature film that would not overlook either the narration or the direction. In 1985, a first 
                        collaboration ensues, Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, the animated adaptation of the manga published by Miyazaki in the
                         magazine Animage. On the strength of this first success, and convinced that there is a place for quality animated feature 
                         films on the Japanese market, they set up a small production studio in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the help of the Tokuma 
                         Shoten publishing company. In 1986 The Castle in the Sky was released on the screens, 
                        the first film officially created by Studio Ghibli, now at the head of more than 40 film and video game productions.</p>

                <article class="about3 aboutContent">
                    <h2>The name</h2>
                    <p>It was Hayao Miyazaki who came up with the idea. A avid flyer, he was inspired by the Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli, a surveillance aircraft that was 
                        developed in Italy during the Second World War. 
                        The Ghibli also refers to the hot air in the Sahara desert, symbolising the breath of fresh air being blown in to Japanese animation.</p>

                    <h2>The biggest success</h2>
                    
                    <p>In 1989, Kiki's Delivery Service became the studio's first major Japanese hit as it was number one in theatres that year. Three years later, Porco Rosso, 
                        almost entirely conceived and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, dethroned Hook and Beauty and the Beast at the Japanese box office. But it was Spirited Away, 
                        the first non-English-language film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film in 2003, that devoted the studio to its international work. 
                        It succeeds Princess Mononoke, which was to be Miyazaki's last film before he retired.</p>

                    <p>Hayao Miyazaki (Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese manga artist and prominent film director 
                        and animator of many popular anime feature films.</p>
                    <p>Miyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where
                         he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the 
                         animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro
                          which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded
                           Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily 
                           retired. Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke the highest-grossing film in Japan. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the 
                           Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an 
                           American Academy Award.</p>

                    <p>Isao Takahata is a Japanese film director, animator, screenwriter and producer who has earned critical international acclaim 
                        for his work as a director of anime films. Takahata is the co-founder of Studio Ghibli along with long-time collaborative partner
                         Hayao Miyazaki. He has directed films such as the grim, war-themed Grave of the Fireflies, the romantic drama Only Yesterday, 
                         the ecological adventure Pom Poko, and the comedy My Neighbors the Yamadas. Unlike most anime directors, Takahata does not draw 
                         and never worked as an animator before becoming a full-fledged director. Takahata's most recent film is The Tale of the Princess 
                         Kaguya, which was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Animated Feature Film at the 87th Academy Awards.</p>
